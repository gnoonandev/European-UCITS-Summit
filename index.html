                European UCITS Summit (EUS) is a two-day conference that sits at the heart of the international Investment Funds sector. As one of the world’s most active 
                domicile hubs, Ireland has become the EMEA base for some of the largest Investment funds globally. Over the last 5 years EUS has emerged as one of Europe’s fastest 
                growing UCITS events.

                EUS is delighted to host our next live event on 15-16 June 2022. We will deliver another world-wide class conference and will adhere to all government Covid safety 
                guidelines. We are extremely excited to bring together our international community of Investment Managers, Custodian providers, thought-leaders and Compliance innovators 
                once again in Dublin’s most famous venue, the Convention Centre.
                
                Join our community at EUS, the chosen platform for all things funds related. Come and share a pin with the thinkers of tomorrow!
